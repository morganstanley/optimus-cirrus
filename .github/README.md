Welcome to Optimus Cirrus. This is our open-sourcing of a set of software infrastructure that we use internally to build and run systems.

Here are some links to talks we have done about the principles behind Optimus Cirrus:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0jJvgiI_xs (ScalaCon 2021; technical portion starts at 24:30)
* https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13108-monad-i-love-you-now-get-out-of-my-type-system (Scala eXchange London 2018)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW8S92jP5sE (ScalaDays 2018)
* https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11182-automatic-parallelisation-and-batching-of-scala-code (Scala eXchange London 2017)
 
The initial release will include the basics that will allow you to see some parts of the runtime in action. We are in the process of preparing more project components to be shared here. 

Please note the LICENSE file.

We hope that you find the project interesting and useful. If you want to ask questions or make comments then please feel free to contact us at `optimus_cirrus (at) morganstanley (dot) com`.
