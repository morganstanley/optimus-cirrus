 * for instance we might batch together two Selects for the same ReferenceQuery at different temporalities. By design,
 * these will map to the same DHTKey (since the ReferenceQuery is the same), and so we will receive two results for
 * that single DHTKey (one per temporality) both within the PrcSingleKeyResponseProto. The wrapper also contains the
 * commandIndices to which those results correspond in the originating batch, and an isPartial marker for the results.
 * We expect the invariant to hold here that responseProto.getResultsCount == commandIndices.size.
