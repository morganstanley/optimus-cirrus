/*
 * One cache to rule them all? ( child classes as just configuration of the class)
 * <p>
 * Goals/reasons:
 * We want just minimum set of operations to support our cache
 * For example by not supporting remove(key) we can get away with CAS all the time (Unlike e.g. CHMv8)
 * <p>
 * Highly integrated: graph needs a set of nodes we don't have to / want to pay for
 * extra bucket info
 * <p>
 * Notes: We caching only PropertyNode(s) and have close connection with them.
 * For example we rely on the fact that they contain hashCode and we don't have
 * to store it again
 * <p>
 * Implementation Note
 * This cache operates as in an optimised manner roughly as follows
 * cacheConcurrency - indicates the number of ledgers that are maintained
 * cacheBatchSize - is the size of each ledger
 * cacheBatchSizePadding - is the padding on the ledger entries
 * <p>
 * if profiling is enabled the concurrency is disabled as you cannot calculate the reuse size accurately
 * otherwise
 * The ledger serves as a staging point. The cacheConcurrency in the number of ledgers
 * and they are assigned to different threads. several threads may share the ledgers, but ideally this would be minimised
 * <p>
 * When an entry is retrieved from the cache we want to update the LRU, and the ledger manage that.
 * We are prepared that the LRU may not be exactly accurate, but the max inaccuracy is the multiple of the
 * cacheConcurrency * (batchSize + batchSizePadding)
 * <p>
 * If any ledger already contains this update then its a no-op
 * otherwise the cache will attempt to add to the ledger (assigned to this thread)
 * <p>
 * If the number of entries exceed the cacheBatchSize then this thread will try to lock all ledgers and update the LRU
 * if this lock is unsuccessful then it will just add to the ledger ( using this additional space set by cacheBatchSize)
 * If there is no space available the lock will be force locked (waiting for other threads)
 * <p>
 * if/when the lock is assigned, the victim thread will update the LRU for all ledgers.
 * <p>
 * By the process above the contention is reduced on the cache and the LRU
 * <p>
 *
 * Notes on equivalent cache size algorithm:
 * We want to compute the smallest new size P <= this.size, such that the number of cache hits wouldn't change
 * under the same order of cache requests. If set on a next run this will result in larger number of evictions, which
 * is a good thing!
 * <p>
 * Consider a set of node requests: A B C D
 * Logically we have an LRU:
 * [header] - D - C - B - A -[header]    // D being the latest and A is the closest to being evicted
 * We keep a global counter insertCount which we increment on every insertion (aka cache miss).
 * We don't update it on re-use (aka cache hit)
 * On cache hit we assign the current value of insertCount to the node 'after' (closer to being evicted)
 * On eviction we inspect the insertMarker of every node and compute the min(insertCount - insertMarker)
 * At any point we can compute P = size - min(insertCount - insertMarker)
 * When external request to return P comes in we need to account for the nodes still not reaching the eviction.
 * In this case we 'simulate' eviction by walking from the header back until we find a node with a marker and asumming
 * size of the cache is shorter by that distance.
 * <p>
 * Assuming node B is cache hit and we mark A, consider the following exhaustive list of possibilities:
 * 1. No node after A was hit ... Eventually A will be evicted after (insertCount - insertMarker)
 * insertions, that means that the cache had to be at least P = size - (insertCount - insertMarker)
 * 2. A was hit... In this case the node after A will get a marker (larger or equal to the one A has) that means
 * the new P = size - (insertCount - insertMarker) will be larger as the node after A is closer to getting evicted
 * 3. Nodes before A were hit. (This is really the same as B being hit)
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * No hits P = size - min(size+ - 0) = 0 (insertCount will reach size on the first eviction and will grow afterwards)
