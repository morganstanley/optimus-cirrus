/**
 * Grid profiler levels. These get progressively more invasive: each level includes the previous.
 *
 * NONE: record environment (JVM-level) metrics. Adds code to start/end of distribution ENVIRON: same as NONE, but will
 * dump CSV/shutdown hook summary of the environment metrics LIGHT: record DAL interactions, Scheduler state changes
 * (run/wait/idle): records sync stacks, stalls, etc. HOTSPOTSLIGHT: like hotspots but lower overhead (no PNodeTask
 * allocation) ~15% CPU, ~25% memory. Does not support profiled block scopes. HOTSPOTS: turns on OGTrace for minimum
 * trace profiling needed to to build per-property hotspots TRACEEVENTS: turns on OGTrace for full trace profilings
