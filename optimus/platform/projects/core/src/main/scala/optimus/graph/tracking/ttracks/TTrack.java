/*
 * Keeps the dependency tree from the tweakable item to all the cacheable nodes - really a shadow dependency tree
 *
 * Concurrency
 *
 * A TTrack has some operations that operate concurrently, and some that only run during certain phases of operation
 * of the tracking scenario
 *
 * A dependency tracker (or tree) is in one of the following states:
 *  - idle, or other states that don't affect TTracks
 *  - evaluating
 *  - tweaking
 *  - cleaning
 *
 * Can run at any time (readonly): toString
 *
 * Can run when tweaking (which is single threaded):
 *   - invalidate & invalidatePreview - only runs due to a addTweak, so only runs during tweaking
 *
 * Can run when evaluating (which is multi threaded):
 *   - merge
 *   - nodeCompleted
 *
 * Can run when cleaning (which is single threaded):
 *   - set
 *   - drop
 *   - compress
 *
 * Future direction and opportunities
 * =======================
 * 1. allow clean to run in parallel as we have multiple cores
 * 2. allow mini-clean cycles (just part of the graph)
 * 3. separate clean cycle from normal cycle id
 * 4. better scheduling control
 * 5. investigate if it is useful to preview a clean - determine what could be cleaned as a read only
 *    task that can be scheduled during evaluates. This may direct the clean, or just quantify the
 *    benefit of a future clean
 *
 * Note: TTrack implements PTracks --- it serves double duty as the 1-element specialized PTracks.
 * This is so that chains of singly linked tracks (a very common pattern) don't need extra objects
 * added in the middle. This is dangerous because it means that a random (not single caller) ttrack
 * can be interpreted as an incorrect ptrack!
