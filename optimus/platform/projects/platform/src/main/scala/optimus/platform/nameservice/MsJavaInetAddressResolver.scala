/**
 * Builds an InetAddressResolver which uses the MSJava AsyncNameService and CachingNameService to wrap the underlying
 * builtinResolver. This provides "asynchronous" (well, on a different thread, and with a timeout) and cached lookups.
 *
 * This gets loaded automatically because it's specified in META-INF/services/java.net.spi.InetAddressResolverProvider,
 * but only on Java 18 or higher (since this SPI didn't exist until Java 18). On Java 17 and lower we instead call
 * MSNameServiceRegistrar.registerDefault() which does some reflective hackery.
