 * This is a duplicate class to optimus.dsi.config.StreamsConfig in dsi_session

 * We need this class since the other class is the actual @stored @entity but needs to be used in dal_core
 * where @stored @entity is not supported since it does not depend on entityplugin which provides
 * the necessary compile time transformations. Therefore, we make this duplicate class to be used here and
 * convert between the two classes when needed.
 *
 * These classes should always be kept IN SYNC!!!
